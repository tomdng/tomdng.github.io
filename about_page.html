        <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">&ensp; Hi, my name is Tommy Dong. I create digital art with 3D software, take photos, and make short films and animations. I'm currently learning web design and programming with Javascript, which was how this website was even possible for me.</h4>
        <h3 class="text-center"><br>Story</h3>
        <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">When I was younger I was fascinated by what people could do with computers, either making programs or producing art with them. There was much one could do with a computer, but there was no where for me to learn. There didn't seem to be many easy to understand tutorials online for all this stuff.<br><br>However, one program in particular had a very large amount of tutorials I couldn't find anywhere else at the time. This was Blender, which most people primarily use to create 3D art and animation. The best part of Blender is that the program is free, and some of the best artists there were mostly self taught. They provided the resources for anyone to learn by themselves with a little time and dedication.<br><br> Eventually I took what I learned and started learning other skills where the same sort of tutorials could be found. You'll be able to see most of what I've learned on this website.<br><br>So this website is the culmination of my efforts pursuing my ambitions, and hopefully I can provide some resources for others to get started, and perhaps create some of my own tutorials. However, I still have a long way to go with everything that I do.<br><br>Thanks for checking out my website and going through these long paragraphs! I'll be updating the website with some helpful resources and places to get started in the blog section.</h4>
