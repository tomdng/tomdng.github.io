        <h3 class="text-center text-paragraph">Hi, my name is Tommy Dong. I create digital art with 3D software, take photos, and create short films and animations. I'm currently learning web design and programming with Javascript, which was how this website was even possible for me.</h3>
        <h2 class="text-center"><br>Story</h2>
        <h3 class="text-center text-paragraph">When I was younger I was fascinated by what people could do with computers, either making programs or producing art with them. There was much one could do with a computer, but there was no where for me to learn. I've attempted in the past to learn Java as well as use programs such as Photoshop but I never found the right resources.<br><br>However, one program in particular had a wealth of information and tutorials I couldn't find anywhere else at the time. This was Blender, which most people primarily use to create 3D art and animation. The best part of Blender is that the program is free, with many prominent Blender was that many artists there were self-taught. They provided the resources for anyone to learn by themselves with a little time and dedication.<br><br> These self-learning skills became universal and I used that to guide my way through my other ambitions, whether it was photography or web design, as the internet always seemed to have a ton of resources to pick and choose from.<br><br>So this website is the culmination of my efforts pursuing my ambitions, and hopefully I can provide some resources for others to get started, and perhaps create some of my own tutorials. However, I still have a long way to go with everything that I do.<br><br>Thanks for checking out my website and going through these long paragraphs! I'll be updating the website with some helpful (at least to me) resources in either the blog or maybe a new section of the website.</h3>
