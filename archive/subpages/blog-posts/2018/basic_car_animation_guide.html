        <h2 class="text-center">Basic Car Animation Tutorial</h2>
        <h3 class="text-center">1/2018</h3>
        <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph "> Hello everyone! Today I will show you a little bit of what I did to model and animate this Tesla Model X for my little animation here. I'll provide you the project to help you along, but I hope you learn to do this yourself. If you use anything directly from the project please credit me at least! That's all I ask for! Anyways, here's the tutorial.
        </h4>
        <h3 class="text-center ">Part I: Modeling</h3>
        <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">So let's start with the modeling. This was the hardest step of the project for me, and my initial goal was simply to model the car. Unfortunately there aren't too many comprehensive tutorials on car modeling, but I personally recommend these two timelapse videos by LMHPoly that show an overview of what you're supposed to do. If you want something a bit more comprehensive then Ian Scott's sports car tutorialseems good (although I personally haven't followed it).<br /><br />

        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">Once you have a car model ready, double check and make sure that all your modifiers have been applied to it as well as your scale and rotation. This will make animating the car a lot easier and helps you run into less issues.
        </h4>
        <h3 class="text-center">Part II: Scene Building</h3>
        <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">Before we start animating the car, we still need to give it a road to drive on and optionally you can also give it a nice background to make a more appealing render (which is something I needed to work a lot more in my own animation).
