            <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph ">This was a transitioning point for me where I started to focus more on my workflow and the process of creating art in order to improve my skills. I put extra effort into writing down my ideas and constructing a rough plan of what I wanted to add before I went to work. And although a few major parts of my story are lacking, overall I felt that I created a pretty warm environment.</h4>

            <div>
                <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">First, I started out writing down what I wanted this scene to depict and draw out a few rough sketches. Then I started my workflow start with basic lighting, and then modeling, texturing, finalized lighting, and then post processing.</h4>

                <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">After getting most of the environment done, I tried to incorporate the characters into the story. Originally, I wanted to have people in it, with the main character still using a regular umbrella versus everyone else using high tech holographic umbrellas (hence the holographic signs).</h4>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">But I have never made any character more complex than a set of blocks, and the same applied to rigging the characters with controllable amartures, or bones. I settled to create robots instead of humans, but in the end I was never satisfied with the final result and just left the environment here.</h4>

            <div>
                <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">Nevertheless, I am still happy with the final result because the environment was made to match the story, to help establish the fact that the main character was living in a city where people didn't use regular umbrellas anymore, hence the umbrella in the trash.<br><br>So while the story is incomplete, I at least do have a nice little scene that has some life added into it, or at least more than what I would've originally intended had I not gone through planning out this project. Now I've taken these lessons to heart and make it a point to make a plan for every project before I start on it.</h4>

                <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph">Before I leave, the original title, had I finished the story here, was called "Analogue Cover." "Cover" refers to the umbrella while "Analogue" is meant to contrast against the digital holographic umbrellas I wanted to include in the scene.</h4>
