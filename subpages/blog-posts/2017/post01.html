            <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph ">Hello! Nice to meet you and happy to see you here. My name is Tommy Dong and I'm currently running this site and blog which I've been developing and maintaining myself from scratch. Right now what I want to do with the blog is to periodically post some more detailed updates now and then about what sort of project I'm trying to work on compared to what I put on my social media.<br><br>In addition to that what I really want to provide are the "behind the scenes" sort of stuff and show what I do when I'm creating something, whether it would be 3D art or a short film. And finally I'd like to post a few tutorials as well as any resources I've found to be helpful and hopefully I'd be able to serve as someone's opportunity to learn my skills with a more guides than I once had when I was going through the same process. I'm pushing myself to get an "Introduction to 3D Modeling Using Blender" post up within the next few weeks for my school club and this website, so watch out for that.</h4>

            <h4 class="text-center text-paragraph ">Now tonight I decided to drive around my area for the first time in my life. I usually head out to a certain location, but I was feeling a bit down and wanted a way to calm and relax myself. For anyone who doesn't like driving, this may not be as helpful but it can apply to just taking a walk outside of your house (or even driving to a park to walk if you like doing both). <br><br>I was just bothered by the fact that I had planned to leave the house to spend time with a few friends but I somehow didn't forsee that fact that we barely made any concrete plans. That didn't bother me, what actually did was the fact that I was a little sick of spending so much time in my house and needed to get out. I still decided to order my dinner through delivery instead of driving up their myself to order it, which didn't help me feel any better.<br><br>So what I needed was to spend some time outside my house, and I chose to do something I normally wouldn't do, which was to take a 20 minute drive just to see what was around me. Not only was I finally at peace with my emotions, I did see a little more of my local area that I've never noticed before, including some amazing streets overlooking into houses far away which I could photograph in the future.<br><br>The moral of the story is that if you ever need to sort of reset yourself, I'd recommend trying something both new and relaxing. Specifically you should just travel around, regardless of whether your means of transpotation or your feet or your wheels. It's not necessarily unique advice, and I kind of knew this already, but it helps to remind myself like I did tonight. So I hope this helped you! <br><br>Have a good night!</h4>
