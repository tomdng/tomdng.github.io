            <p class="text-center">For a lot of students, senioritis is generally a drop in grades and motivation at school. This normally occurs after we’ve finished the gruesome college application process. When I had this sort of condition, my grades were mostly similar and I still interested enough for most of my classes. However, my hobbies suffered. Between, school, work, and wanting some relaxation for once, it was very difficult to continue the various personal projects that I did on my free time. I had a lot of ideas, but most of them ended up nowhere. <br/><br/> I wanted to keep working on my 3D piece (private spaces), my website, and learn Javascript after I finished my college applications. While I did achieve those three goals, they took me much longer than I usually do. By this day I wanted to have all the pages on my website updated and have made significant progress on a 3D short animation, but my website’s still incomplete and my animation is just a rough sketch on a sheet of paper. <br/><br/>I had a bit of a writer’s block during this time, but instead of writing it was every creative outlet I had. I spent a lot of time and energy on my college application, pacing everything I did around the essay deadlines for each university. Even if I didn’t directly show my work to most of these colleges, much of my motivation to create content came from it. I wanted to prove to both these universities and myself that I was an independent, self-taught content creator with big goals and big dreams. The content I made was meant to prove both them and myself. But I never gave my work more purpose than that, so when I finished my college applications, all my effort sort of just plummeted. <br/><br/>Right now, I’m starting to get back on track. This time I’m trying to do things for myself rather than someone else. It’s definitely a little selfish, but motivation is often highest when the reward comes from yourself rather than from someone or somewhere else. But even motivation falters from time to time, so you’ll need a goal. I set myself both big goals, which are more like dreams I may never achieve, and small goals that serve as milestones towards what I want. You need a dream to excite and inspire you to reach the smaller goals that are a little more boring, but realistic and possible. If you don’t have any sort of goal, you can’t really be persistent and determined whenever motivation fades away. <br/><br/>I didn’t gave myself enough time to think about what I wanted, and if there’s any sort of regret I had over my high school years, it’d be this. Fortunately, I can learn my lesson and move onto something bigger now. I’ve finally graduated and made it through high school, and I’m looking forward to who I’ll be and what I’ll make over the next four years at college.

            <figcaption class="text-center">There were many ups and downs throughout my high school years. Still I'll miss this place.</figcaption>
            <p>And one more thing for you seniors in high school. It won’t be easy to actually set these sort of goals. I had to think a lot lately, because earlier this year I thought I knew what direction I was heading. I now see that I really had no clue about what I actually wanted from myself and my future. Please don’t let yourself fall into senioritis. It’s just another set of characteristics and actions that have been predetermined for you at a time where you should only be thinking for yourself. I had failed to prioritize my hobbies a little more above all the other things I did in life, and in doing so I suffered quite the productivity lost. In the end, you’ve worked quite a lot these four years in high school, so you deserve to think for yourself. You can lessen the burden on whatever you chose to, but make sure you can get something out of that, whether it’s more time to actually relax or to focus more on your own hobbies.
